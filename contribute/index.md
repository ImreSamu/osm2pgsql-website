# Contribute

Osm2pgsql is an Open Source project. Your contributions are welcome. You can
find the source code and issue tracker on
[Github](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql).

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for some information about how to contribute.

There is a kind of [road map]({% link road-map.md %}) for osm2pgsql development.
It’s not to be understood as a definite “this is what we’ll do” document, but
as a rough overview of the shared understanding of the maintainers about where
we are and in what areas we see need for work. It is incomplete.

## Tests and Continuous Integration

[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql)
[![Appveyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7abwls7hfmb83axj/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/branch/master)
[![macOS Build Status](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/workflows/OSX%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/actions)

We have a growing suite of tests, new features and bug fixes should always
have test coverage.

The `master` branch and all pull requests are checked automatically using
Travis CI (Linux builds), Appveyor (Windows builds), and Github Actions (macOS
builds). (And yes, this should be unified, but nobody had the time to do that
yet.)
